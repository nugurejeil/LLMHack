Professor: When we think of Impressionism—think Monet, Renoir—we usually talk about their style: the loose brushstrokes, the focus on light, the vibrant colors. But today, I want to talk about technology. Specifically, a tiny invention that made the entire movement possible: the paint tube.

Before the mid-19th century, painters had to grind their own pigments and mix them with oil. They stored these paints in pig bladders. Yes, animal bladders. They were messy, hard to seal, and prone to bursting. Because of this, painting was almost exclusively a studio activity. You couldn't easily travel with your supplies.

Then, in 1841, an American painter named John Goffe Rand invented the collapsible tin paint tube.

This changed everything. Suddenly, paint was portable and preserved for longer. Artists could leave their studios and go outside. This practice is called "En plein air"—painting in the open air.

Because they were outside, they could observe natural light directly. They saw how light changed quickly—how a haystack looked different at sunrise compared to sunset. They needed to paint fast to capture that fleeting moment. This necessity for speed led to the characteristic "messy" or "rapid" brushstrokes of Impressionism.

So, without that simple tin tube, Monet might never have painted his water lilies by the pond. The technology literally shaped the art.
